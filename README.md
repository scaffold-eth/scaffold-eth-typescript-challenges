# 🏗 scaffold-eth | 🏰 BuidlGuidl

## 🚩 Challenge 0: 🎟 Simple NFT Example 🤓

🎫 Create a simple NFT to learn basics of 🏗 scaffold-eth. You'll use [👷‍♀️ HardHat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) to compile and deploy smart contracts. Then, you'll use a template React app full of important Ethereum components and hooks. Finally, you'll deploy an NFT to a public network to share with friends! 🚀

🌟 The final deliverable is an app that lets users purchase and transfer NFTs. Deploy your contracts to a testnet and then build and upload your app to a public web server. Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

```

```sh
cd challenge-0-simple-nft
git checkout challenge-0-simple-nft
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```sh

# Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛

> ⛽️ You'll need to get some funds from the faucet for gas.

> 🦊 At first, please **don't** connect MetaMask. If you already connected, please click **logout**:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2653167/142484483-1439d925-8cef-4b1a-a4b2-0f022eebc0f6.png)

> 🔥 We'll use **burner wallets** on localhost...

> 👛 Explore how **burner wallets** work in 🏗 scaffold-eth by opening a new _incognito_ window and navigate it to http://localhost:3000. You'll notice it has a new wallet address in the top right. Copy the incognito browsers' address and send localhost test funds to it from your first browser:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2653167/142483685-d5c6a153-da93-47fa-8caa-a425edba10c8.png)

> 👨🏻‍🚒 When you close the incognito window, the account is gone forever. Burner wallets are great for local development but you'll move to more permanent wallets when you interact with public networks.

# Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting

> ✏️ Mint some NFTs! Click the `MINT NFT` button in the YourCollectibles tab.

👀 You should see your collectibles start to show up:

![nft3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/526558/124386983-48965300-dcb3-11eb-88a7-e88ad6307976.png)

👛 Open an **incognito** window and navigate to http://localhost:3000

🎟 Transfer an NFT to the incognito window address using the UI:

![nft5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/526558/124387008-58ae3280-dcb3-11eb-920d-07b6118f1ab2.png)

👛 Try to mint an NFT from the incognito window.

> Can you mint an NFT with no funds in this address? You might need to grab funds from the faucet to pay the gas!

🕵🏻‍♂️ Inspect the `Debug Contracts` tab to figure out what address is the `owner` of `YourCollectible`?

🔏 You can also check out your smart contract `YourCollectible.sol` in `packages/hardhat-ts/contracts`.

💼 Take a quick look at your deploy script `00_deploy_your_collectible.ts` in `packages/hardhat-ts/deploy`.

📝 If you want to make frontend edits, open `YourCollectible.tsx` in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/app/routes/your-collectibles`.

# Checkpoint 3: 💾 Deploy it! 🛰

🛰 Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> Change the `defaultNetwork` in `packages/hardhat-ts/hardhat.config.ts` to `goerli`

🔐 Generate a **deployer address** with `yarn generate`

![nft7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/526558/124387064-7d0a0f00-dcb3-11eb-9d0c-195f93547fb9.png)

👛 View your **deployer address** using `yarn account`

![nft8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/526558/124387068-8004ff80-dcb3-11eb-9d0f-43fba2b3b791.png)

⛽️ Use a faucet like [faucet.paradigm.xyz](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to fund your **deployer address**.

> ⚔️ **Side Quest:** Keep a 🧑‍🎤 [punkwallet.io](https://punkwallet.io/) on your phone's home screen and keep it loaded with testnet eth. 🧙‍♂️ You'll look like a wizard when you can fund your **deployer address** from your phone in seconds.

🚀 Deploy your NFT smart contract:

```sh
yarn deploy
```

> 💬 Hint: You can set the `defaultNetwork` in `hardhat.config.ts` to `goerli` OR you can `yarn deploy --network goerli`.

---

# Checkpoint 4: 🚢 Ship it! 🚁

> ✏️ Edit the `TARGET_NETWORK_INFO` in `providersConfig.ts` (in `packages/vite-app-ts/src/config`) to be the public network where you deployed your smart contract.

📦 Build your frontend:

```sh
yarn build
```

💽 Upload your app to surge:

```sh
yarn surge
```

(You could also `yarn s3` or maybe even `yarn ipfs`?)

⚠️ Run the automated testing function to make sure your app passes:

```sh
yarn test
```
